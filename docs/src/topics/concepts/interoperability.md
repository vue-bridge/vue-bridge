# Interoperability

Reading this documentation, you will come across the terms "interoperable components/code/library", "Interoperability" etc in lots of places. In the context of VueBridge, here's what this means:

**A component/test/library is interoperable if it can run/used in both Vue 2 and Vue 3 projects.**


## Aspects and concepts of interoperability

Creating an interoperable library/component is a multi-faceted problem - there's different aspects to take into account, and these aspects require different kinds of solutions on different levels.

On the rest of this page we will introduce these different aspects. You can dive deeper into each one by selecting the matching chapter in the sidebar.
